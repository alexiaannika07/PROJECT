    <p id="history">
    	Earth is one of the oldest planets in existence. There have been tons and tons of theories as to how this beautiful and amazing planet came about. This planet has sustained humans and helped us survive. But as it slowly grows old, other people disrespect and disregard it's value and start to pay no mind to it. <br>

    <br>

    	My advocacy is all about the Earth’s current problems more specifically focusing on air and water pollution. Currently, news on air and water pollution, it’s causes, and it’s effects are currently circling the media. And note that not only is this problem a new one, but one that has been going on and on for lots of years. Many scientists and researchers have advised the people and constantly reminded us on why we need to stop this and what will happen when we dont take effect.
