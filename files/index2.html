		Why This Advocacy? 
    <br>
    <br>
		This advocacy is all about caring for our planet and
       showing love for our Earth. Earth is of utmost
       importance, and Earthly is here to prove that.
       Channel your voices to us, and your efforts and we
       promise it will not be wasted.
   </p>

<img src="../images/waterc.jpg" class="waterc">
	<p id="why3">You can help by actively volunteering in our clean
up drives, stationed in different parts and areas of
the country. If you can’t actively volunteer but
want to help our cause, you can donate funds to
help our active volunteers. Proceeds will surely be
used for this advocacy and this advocacy only.<br>
<br>
But, we call to you and your families that in your
own little ways, please help clean and lessen the
pollution in our environment. Let’s learn to
segregate our trash at our own homes, avoid
burning leaves and paper, learn to pick up trash,
and all others. <br>
<br>
We should care for our Mother Earth and this is
where we can start.
Join us, be an agent of Earth!</p>
